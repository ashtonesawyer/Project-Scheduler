# Project-Scheduler
This program will take in information about a project, including the 
due date and an estimate of how many hours it will take to complete,
and automatically generate and schedule Google Calendar events for times to 
work on the given project.
## Elements
### Project Scheduler
This is the main driver of the project. It manages all of the data
and interfaces with Google Calendar. 
### GUI 
This is still in progress. 
This takes user input, error checks as needed, and parses it for the project 
scheduler. 
## Installation
Before running the code, the Google client library for python must be downloaded. 
```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```
